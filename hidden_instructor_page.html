    <h2>InnSync Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>At InnSync, our design choices are guided by one principle: <strong>put the stakeholder first</strong>. We serve two primary stakeholders:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hotel Owners</strong> – Often traditional Indian businessmen who value quick, clear, and tangible returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Hotel Managers</strong> – The on-ground decision-makers who need speed, clarity, and minimal friction in daily operations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every element on our landing page exists to serve these stakeholders’ needs.</p>
    
    <h3>Why We Designed It This Way</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Persuasive for the Hotel Owner</strong> – The page speaks directly to their pain point: lost revenue. We highlight the risk dramatically and immediately show the exact percentage of potential gains they’re missing. This creates urgency without fluff.</li>
        <li><strong>Focused on Saving Money</strong> – The primary hook is measurable: “Increase your revenue by more than 10%.” It’s a number they can relate to, calculate, and believe in.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Call-to-Action That Matches Behavior</strong> – We feature the phone number prominently at multiple points because our audience is more likely to call than fill out forms. Forms are secondary. Calling is familiar, faster, and requires less trust upfront.</li>
        <li><strong>Language Preference Up Front</strong> – As soon as a visitor arrives, we ask for their language preference. This respects cultural diversity, breaks down communication barriers, and improves comprehension from the very first interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Problem → Solution Flow</strong> – We lay out the buyer’s risk (unrecorded bookings, lost revenue), then present our solution in simple, numbered points. No jargon. No wasted words.</li>
        <li><strong>Short & Crisp</strong> – The landing page is deliberately concise. We know our stakeholders don’t have time for lengthy reading. We give them the essentials to make a decision quickly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In essence: Our landing page isn’t just designed to look good—it’s designed to convert in the real world, for real hotel owners, with their habits, preferences, and pain points in mind.</p>

    <h2>Customer Testimonial (Sample)</h2>
    <div class="testimonial">
        "InnSync completely transformed the way we monitor our hotel’s bookings and occupancy. We’ve closed revenue leaks within the first month!"
        <br>– Sample Hotel Owner
    </div>
    <p><em>If placed publicly, this testimonial would appear on the landing page just above the call-to-action section.</em></p>
